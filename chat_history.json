The color of the dot will be determined by the `calculateWarrantyStatus` function in `warrantyUtils.ts`.\n\nTo implement search and filtering, I'll add a `TextInput` component at the top of the `HomeScreen` to act as a search bar. I'll use the `useState` hook to manage the search query and filter the displayed items accordingly. A \"No results\" message will be displayed when the filtered list is empty.\n\nFor notifications, I'll use the `expo-notifications` library to schedule local push notifications. I'll add a toggle in the `SettingsScreen` to allow users to enable or disable notifications. I'll request permission for notifications when the app is first launched or when the user toggles the setting on.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-26T05:06:32.772275"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement the color-coded status system, search & filter functionality, and basic notifications for your SafeKeep app. Let me first read the current files to understand the existing structure."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/warrantyUtils.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/WarrantyCard.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/settings.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/item.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me install the expo-notifications dependency for push notifications:"}, {"type": "dependency_management", "action": "install", "dependencies": ["expo-notifications"], "status": "complete", "success": true, "stdout": "Progress: resolved 1, reused 0, downloaded 0, added 0\n\u2009WARN\u2009 deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from@7.18.9: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained.
